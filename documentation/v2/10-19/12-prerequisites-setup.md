# Prerequisites - Before setting up an AIFactory

## Step 1) Create Azure DevOps (or Github) projects
- **Purpose:** Where the AIFactory acceleration code resides
- **Role needed:** Central IT. Microsoft EntraID administrator. Azure DevOps administrator
- **Mandatory:** Yes.
- **What:** CODE repository: Create your Azure DevOps project to store the AIFactory acceleration code (IaC and templates) and Azure DevOps Service Connections, based on Service principal "esml-common-bicep" (see step 3-7)
- **TODO**: 
    1) Create a new Azure DevOps project (or reuse an existing one). GOAL & REASON: Admin to Create a Service Connection, based on a Service Principal (step 5) with OWNER permission on subscription, and GET,LIST, SET access policies on seeding keyvault (step 3). The Service Connection should have access to "all pipelines" in Azure Devops (at crestion step there is a checkbox for this)
        - [How-to guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser): Create Azure Devops project
    2) Create 2 GIT repositories in your Azure DevOps
        - ESML-AIFactory-Common
        - ESML-AIFactory-Project001
        - [How-to guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/creatingrepo?view=azure-devops&tabs=visual-studio-2022) : Create GIT repos

## Step 2) - Create Azure subscriptions (Enterprise Scale landing zone: Application landingzones)
- **Purpose:** To have the AIFactory DEV, TEST, PROD environments
- **Role needed:** Central IT / Cloud Team
- **Mandatory:** DEV is mandatory. 1 Subscription
- A) Create Subscriptions
    - Option A (Recommended to try out the AIFactory): Create 1 Azure subscription to act as the Dev environment. The AIFactory can simulate Test, Prod workflows (MLOps, LLMOps) with only a Dev
    - Option B (Recommended for productional use): For full AIFactory, create 3 Azure subscriptions (Dev, Stage, Prod)
    - [How-to guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/initial-subscriptions): Create Azure subscriptions
    - [Read more](./14-networking-privateDNS.md) about AIFactory Enterprise Scale Landing Zones
- B) Enable resource providers: Enable the resource providers as [specified here](./12-resourceproviders.md)
    - [Tip: You can use the Powershell script to automate this](../../../environment_setup/aifactory/bicep/esml-util/26-enable-resource-providers.ps1)

## Step 3) Create an Azure keyvault for the admin of Microsoft Entra ID: The so-called `seeding keyvault` (IaC purpose), and created Service principals
- **Purpose:** For the admin (usually Central IT), who has access to Microsoft Entra ID to created service principals, to store information, to be consumed by AIFactory IaC pipeline.
- **Role needed:** Central IT / Cloud Team
- **Mandatory: Yes**
- [How-to guide: Create & Use the AIFactory seeding keyvault](./12-seeding-keyvault.md)

## Step 4) Networking: Allocate vNet ranges in your IP-plan: 3 vNets with /16 CIDR size (at least /20)
- **Purpose:** To be able to peer the AIFactory later. 
- **Role needed:** Network team within Central IT / Cloud Team
- **Mandatory:** No. We an setup an AIFactory standalone. But it cannot be peered later on. We need to use Bastion & VM to access it.
- **Mandatory with /16 size:** No. 16 is optimal, but a size /18 will also work (10 0000 IP addresses or more), but not recommended for productional use (not even for DEV environment)
- **TODO**: Alloate at 1 or 3 vNet ranges of size /16

## Step 5) Create 3 service principals, and store info(appid, ObjectId, Secret) in the seeding keyvault [(see step 3)](#step-3-create-an-azure-keyvault-for-the-admin-of-microsoft-entra-id-the-so-called-seeding-keyvault-iac-purpose-and-created-service-principals)
- **Purpose:** To be used to setup the AIFactory. The information of the service principals, ObjectID, ApplicationID, and Secret needs to be stored in the seeding keyvault
    - **SP1: `esml-common-bicep-sp`:** IaC purpose. This service principal will be used as a Service connection in Azure Devops and in a pipeline to create the AIFactory.
        - Store the info in the seeding keyvault.
        - Secret names example: `esml-common-bicep-sp-id`, `esml-common-bicep-sp-oid`,`esml-common-bicep-sp-secret`
    - **SP2: `esml-common-sp`:**: DataOps automation purpose. This SP be delegated access by SP1 to AIFactory resources in the Common area of the AIFactory
    - **SP3: `esml-project001-sp`:** MLOps automation purpose. This SP be delegated access by SP1 to AIFactory resources to a proejct specific area of the AIFactory
        - Tip: Create 5 or 10 in one go, and store the seeding keuyvault, to have for later. 
            - Example: `esml-project001-sp,esml-project002-sp,esml-project003-sp`
- **Role needed:** Microsoft EntraID administrator: Central IT / Cloud Team
- **Mandatory:** Yes
- **TODO**: Create the 3 service principals below
### AFactory IaC Service Principal (1st)
    - Name: esml-common-bicep-sp
    - Permissions: OWNER on Subscriptions created in step 2
    - Purpose: For the ESML AIFactory CoreTeam and its data ingestion team, for DataOps pipelines unattended
### Role: CoreTeam Service Principal (2nd)
    - Name: esml-common-sp
    - Permissions: None
    - Purpose: For the ESML AIFactory CoreTeam and its data ingestion team, for DataOps pipelines unattended
### Role: ProjectTeam Service Principal (3rd)
    - Name: esml-project001-sp
    - Permissions: None
    - Purpose: For the ESML AIFactory project teams to be able to run their MLOps and LLMOps pipelines unattended

[Read more](./12-permissions-users-ad-sps.md) here aobut the permisssions and service principals

## Step 6) Delegate User Access: Onboard a Microsoft EntraID user, with access to the Azure DevOps created in step 1, and with OWNER permission on the Subscriptions created in Step 2, 
- **Purpose:** Efficiency. To be able to troubleshoot, manually login to Azure for `the AIFactory setup mentor`
- **Role needed:** Microsoft EntraID administrator: Central IT / Cloud Team
â€”** Mandatory: ** Yes. It is very hard to debug and troubleshoot if there are no insights that the permission is set correctly. Nedd needs to have read access in EntraID to see the service principal and keyvault permissions. Someone needs to verify that the Azure Devops Service connection works, that the service principal (SP) esml-common-bicep has Get, List, Set to seeding keyvault, and that the SP is OWNER on the subscriptions.
- **TODO**: 
    1) Create a user in Microsoft EntraID
        - [How-to guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-create-delete-users) : Create user
    2) Azure DevOps: Delegate access to the Azure DevOps project for the user, with the role BASIC. (Not role: STAKEHOLDER)
        - Access to GIT in that Azure DevOps project is required.
        - [How-to guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-users-team-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page) : Delegate user access
    3) Azure: Delegate either permission as option A or B to the user. (A downside with option B is a lower means to troubleshoot during the setup phase)
        - Option A) Delegate OWNER permission on the Subscriptions created in [Step 2](#step-2---created-azure-subscriptions--enterprise-scale-landing-zones)
        - Option B) Delegate OWNER permission on the Resource Groups created by the AIFactory via the service principal `esml-common-bicep-sp` [created in step 5](#step-5-create-3-service-principals-where-1-of-them-has-owner-permission-on-the-subscriptions-created-in-step-2-and-store-informamtion-in-the-seeding-keyvault-see-step-3)
            - Note: To delegate a user access to the resource groups, you need to have [SETUP the AIFactory first](./13-setup-aifactory.md)
                - Resource groups that will be created look similar as this: `dc-heroes-esml-project001-weu-dev-001-rg`, `dc-heroes-esml-project001-weu-test-001-rg`, `dc-heroes-esml-project001-weu-prod-001-rg` 

## Step 7) Delgate Service Principal Access in Azure Devops + Import IaC pipelines + Set service connection to pipeline steps
- **Purpose:** Since only an Azure DevOps admin has permission to create a service connection and select that on a pipeline. 
    - E.g. the `AIFactory setup mentor` will not have permission with the role of stakeholder
- **Role needed:**: Azure Devops admin
- **Mandatory:** Yes
- **TODO**: [Azure Devops: Create service connection + Import IaC pipelines + Set service connection to pipeline steps](./12-prereq-ado-create-servicecon-import-ado-pipelines.md)

## Step 8) Register Resource providers on Subscriptions

[How-to - run script to enable resource providers ](./12-resourceproviders.md)

## Step 9) If you want to have Private DNS zones centrally in HUB (recommended) = centralDnsZoneByPolicyInHub=true
1) Create the Private DNS Zones in the HUB as specified: 
    - [How-to - networking](./14-networking-privateDNS.md) 
2) Apply the policy to add A-records for all PaaS services that create a private endpoint to have an A-record added to the central Private DNS zones
    - [How-to - networking](./14-networking-privateDNS.md)
        - Action: A Policy can be assigned on MGMT group (or subscription) that for every type or private DNS zones (for PaaS) will create records, in the DNS Zone.
