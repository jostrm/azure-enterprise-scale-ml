## Network topology - Hub & Spoke & DNS Zones

You can choose to have Private DNS Zones Centrally in HUB (recommended) or in the AIFactory spoke, in its common resource group (default):
    - Option A (Recommended to try out the AIFactory):  Run the AI Factory standalone with its own Private DNS Zone. Default behaviour, no change needed
    - Option B (Recommended for productional use): Create a policy to create the private DNS zones in your HUB, and set the AIFactory config flag `centralDnsZoneByPolicyInHub` to `true`
        - The flag `centralDnsZoneByPolicyInHub` can be seen in [this AIFactory config file:e](../../../environment_setup/aifactory/parameters/10-esml-globals-4-13_21_22.json)

### How-to: Configure Azure PaaS services to use private DNS zones (centralDnsZoneByPolicyInHub:true)

This is needed to avoid having the private DNS zones locally, which will work. 
But not recommended for productional, scalability reasons. 

## Challenge - manual work
If you do not have central Privat DNS Zones, the DNS forwarding will not work until you also add conditional forwarding manually. 
- You will have to then create ~40 conditional forwarding, for all your onpremises DNS server, to have it working
- The records needs to exists also in the HUB's private DNS zone and Custom DNS server - a manual task for each AIFactory project that is created.           
- If the storage account with private endpoint, and users are using both public or private access, it will not work, since users are not in DNS zone.

## SOLUTION
- If user are on-premises and tries to connect to a public Azure Machine Learning workspace or storage account - the on-premies DNS will ping the Custom DNS server that will call Azure to provide DNS, that in turn will know the public IP. This will work
- TODO: The custom DNS Server, needs to be in the central HUB
- TODO: A Policy can be assigned on MGMT group (or subscription) that for every type or private DNS zones (for PaaS) will create records, in the DNS Zone.

- TODO: Create a central private endpoint for all, somewhere.This, since our Azure portals (such as Azure ML portal) are global, we need a private endpoint to that portalt. 
    - If you have traditional Hub/Spoke topology, create it in the Hub.Â 				
    - If you have WWAN - you have a central vNet to the WWAN-hub, where Pivate DNS resolvers and DNS forward can live (for 1 or many if multi region) in WWAN hub.

### How-to: Give user access from corp on-premises network - Custom DNS Server hosted onpremises
This is needed to avoid Bastion and VM being the only way to access the secure AIFactory
