# Configure AIFactory common
This is done by ESML Core team, before creating 1st AIFactory project.

1) Copy all configuration files, by running [this Notebook](../../../copy_my_subfolders_to_my_grandparent/01_init_templates_ALL.ipynb)
    - This will copy folders and settings from ESML AIFactory GITHUB repo, to your local root path. 
        - `aifactory` folder - local configuration for IaC
        - `mlops` folder - mlops templates
        - `settings` folder - project specific temaplates
2) Configure all files [here](../../../../aifactory/parameters/)
3) WIP - Import the Azure Devops / GHA pipelines
4) WIP - Configure the pipelines
5) WIP - Run the pipelines
