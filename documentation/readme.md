| 40-49 | `All`|`FAQ`| Various frequently asked questions. Please look here, before contacting an ESML AIFactory mentor. |

It is also organized via the four components of the ESML AIFactory:

## ESML AIFactory: The 2 project types and the AIFactory Personas
Technically, The AIFactory has automation to setup 2 project types, a set of services glued together with private networking & RBAC, a team gets access to (automation process takes 35min), with templates for DataOps, MLOps or GenAIOps.

Personas is a tool the AIFactory uses to map *tools, processes and people*, to scale AI **organizationally** as well. Personas is used to: 

1) **Find resource gaps, define responsibility, or find redesign needs:** If you do not have people in your organization that fit a persona description needed to support a process step, you either need to redesign the architecture, change the process, or onboard new people with that persona. Personas is a good tool to define scope of **responsibility**
2) **Education:** Mapping personas to specific **Azure services** in the architecture provides the benefits of offering **educational** sessions and online courses to upskill within.
3) **Security & Access:** Personas mapped to **processes, architectures and services** can be used to define which services they need access to in a process.
4) **Project planning & Interactions** Personas mapped to each other can be used see which personas that primarily interacts with each other, to be used to setup sync meetings and project planning.
