# BICEP to provision the AIFactory and new projects
This repo is BICEP first. Meaning that Terraform has lower prio. 

You can use either **GITHUB** or **Azure Devops** automation pipelines (that uses BICEP under neath the hood)

You do **not need** to interact with either BICEP or Terraform, since the AIFactory provides automation pipelines.

We recommend to use the GITHUB option, that uses Github actions with workflows, and also is provided as a TEMPLATE Github repository.

## Workflow: AIFactory Common 
Start with setting up a common AIFactory environment, example, the DEV environment
- [infra-aifactory-common.yaml](./esml-infra-common/infra-aifactory-common.yaml)

## Workflow: AIFactory projects
Then you can import and run the pipelines to setup 1-M projects. There are 2 AIFactory project types supported as of now: 
- [infra-project-genai.yaml](./infra-project-genai.yml)
- [infra-project-esml.yaml](./infra-project-esml.yml)


> [!TIP]
>  A quicker & easier way? You can use the AIFactory Github Template repository to get a bootstrappd repo quickly (as a mirror repo, or "bring your own repo"). [AIFactory Template Repo](https://github.com/jostrm/azure-enterprise-scale-ml-usage), ready to run. All files copied already. Just configure and run.
