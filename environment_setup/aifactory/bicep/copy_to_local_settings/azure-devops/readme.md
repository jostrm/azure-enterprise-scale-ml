# Azure Devops orchestration: automation to setup AIFactory, onboard projects and people
To import pipeline templates you may choose either: 
- **Classic ADO RELEASE pipelines** esml-ado-pipelines, these have more features, and are updated more frequent
    - Updated: 2024-03, 2024-06, 2024-08
- **YAML ADO BUILD pipeline** esml-yaml-pipelines, less frequent updated, and may break due to lack of _parameters_
    - Updated: 2024-03

> [!TIP]
>  Do you want to use Github instead of Azure Devops? Then you can use the AIFactory Github Template repository to get a bootstrappd repo quickly (as a mirror repo, or "bring your own repo"). [AIFactory Template Repo](https://github.com/jostrm/azure-enterprise-scale-ml-usage).
