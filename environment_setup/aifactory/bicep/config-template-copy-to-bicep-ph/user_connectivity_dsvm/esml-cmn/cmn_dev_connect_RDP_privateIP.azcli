#Q: How to run AZ CLI in VS Code
#A: Mark all code below, and run in VS Code with (CTRL+ä) if Swedish keyboard
###
### What: This will connect to a DSVM within the ESML AI factory network DEV environment.
### -> The technology used is Remote Desktop (RDP) over PRIVATE IP to DSVM via BASTION tunnel.

# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli
az version # 2.43.1  (version 2.32 or later)

## 1) This is cached - you need to do these 3 lines of code once and a while
# See ESML /settings/enterprise_specific/dev_test_prod_settings.json
$subscription_id = "todo_subscription_id" # change depending on (DEV,TEST,PROD) in ESML enterprise_specific settings
az account clear
az login
az account list
az account set --subscription $subscription_id
## 1) END

#2) Mark all code below, and run in VS Code with (CTRL+ä) if Swedish keyboard

# CONFIGURE ONCE 
$esml_ai_factory_instance = "001" # admin only changes this (Common RG name)
$resource_id_suffix="001" # admin only changes (this Bastion host suffix)
$rg_prefix = "abc-def-"
$subscription_id = "todo_subscription_id"
$locationSuffix ="weu"

# CONFIGURE PER common ENVIRONMENT (dev,test,prod)
$dev_test_prod = "dev"
$dsvm_number = "001" # Your team may have multiple DSVM in the resource group,suffixs: 001,002,003

## Info: Then when logged in, this line will trigger Remote Desktop client on your Windows computer, with your AD-user, and you have your AD-user profile on the DSVM, connected with private IP (via Bastion)
az network bastion rdp --name "bastion-${locationSuffix}-${dev_test_prod}-${resource_id_suffix}" --resource-group "${rg_prefix}esml-common-${locationSuffix}-${dev_test_prod}-${esml_ai_factory_instance}" --target-resource-id "/subscriptions/${subscription_id}/resourceGroups/${rg_prefix}esml-common-${locationSuffix}-${dev_test_prod}-${esml_ai_factory_instance}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/dsvm-cmn-${locationSuffix}-${dev_test_prod}-${dsvm_number}"

######### If problem with the above,  try the below, that also --disable-gateway
#az network bastion rdp --disable-gateway --name "bastion-${locationSuffix}-${dev_test_prod}-${resource_id_suffix}" --resource-group "${rg_prefix}esml-common-${locationSuffix}-${dev_test_prod}-${esml_ai_factory_instance}" --target-resource-id "/subscriptions/${subscription_id}/resourceGroups/${rg_prefix}esml-common-${locationSuffix}-${dev_test_prod}-${esml_ai_factory_instance}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/dsvm-cmn-${locationSuffix}-${dev_test_prod}-${dsvm_number}"

# 2) End
