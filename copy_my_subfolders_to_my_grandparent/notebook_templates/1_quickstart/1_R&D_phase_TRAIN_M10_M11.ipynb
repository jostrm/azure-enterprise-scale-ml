    "# R&D phase: About this notebook\n",
    "- This notebooks support both CLASSIFICATION and REGRESSION\n",
    "- Purpose: TRAINS a model with Azure AutoML and with AZURE compute cluster and calculates test_set scoring, automatically compares if newly trained model is better.\n",
    "    - To iteratively try different ML-algorithms see what's best, change performance settings, train again.\n",
    "    - Also to try different apporoaches, classification or regression approach - which is better for the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q: `WHEN to move on form R&D phase to PRODUCTION phase notebook?`\n",
    "    - When you are happy with the MODEL (or if you have a big dataset that requires pipeline for training) - then go to the next notebook `2a_PRODUCTION_phase` to create PIPELINES: \n",
    "        - PRODUCTION PHASE & MLOps requires 1 `training pipeline`, and a `scoring pipeline` or `scoring online endpoint`, for inference \n",
    "- This notebook - Details:\n",
    "    - 1) Automaps data as Azure ML datasets. Based on your `lake_settings.json`\n",
    "    - 2) Splits the GOLD data into 3 buckets. \n",
    "        - NB this is done with local compute, not Azure, use \n",
    "             - Option 1: `2a_PRODUCTION_phase` training pipeline if data is too big for local RAM memory\n",
    "             - Option 2: Stay in this notebook & local split of data, but increase RAM memory of your/this Azure VM developer (DSVM) computer.\n",
    "             - Option 2: Stay in this notebook & local split of data, but reduce data size. Only use a sample .parquet (or .csv) file in the IN-folder.\n",
    "    - 3) Trains model\n",
    "    - 4) Registers model\n",
    "    - 5) Calculate test_set scoring\n",
    "    - 6) Deploys model - ONLINE endpoint to AKS\n",
    "    - 7) Inference: Smoke testing, using the ONLINE endpoint - get result back, saves the result to datalake also\n",
    "    - DONE.\n",
    "    \n",
